# Education Management System RESTful API

Education Management System (**EMS**) is
a [learning content management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system). It is a software
application that provides a framework that handles some of the key aspects of the learning process. **EMS** is a _platform_ that allows you to create, manage, host, and track digital learning content. The main objective of **EMS** is
to _enhance the learning process_ by saving customers time.

## Installation

- Running the **EMS** _RESTful API_ requires JDK 17. For best performance use Liberica JDK 17,
  download from [here](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#).
- Apache Maven 3.8.6+, download from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- Data management is operated by using a relational database management system. **MySQL Community Server**, _version_ **
  8.0.30** required, downloaded from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
- Depending on the features you want to use, you may need some third-party software, such
  as [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/download/#section=windows) (payed)
  or [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) (free) for data modeling, SQL development, and
  comprehensive administration for the system data.

## Configuration

- Datasource location, port and name should be changed from ```application.yaml```:

```yaml 
spring.datasource.url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:{port}/{database_name}?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
```

- MySQL server credentials should be changed from ```application.yaml```:

```yaml 
spring.datasource.username: {username}
spring.datasource.password: {password}
```

- Education Management System is using **SMTP** communication service, provided by Google Workspace, before proceeding
  with the configuration steps bellow, the SMTP server must be configured successfully. Follow the Google support
  article to configure the SMTP server
  from [here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en#:~:text=Set%20up%20the%20app%20or,re%20using%20TLS%2C%20enter%20587.)
  and a useful GeeksforGeeks article from [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/spring-boot-sending-email-via-smtp/).
  Once the SMTP communication setup finished, place your mail application credentials in ```application.yaml```:

```yaml
environments.mail-properties.test.username: { LDAP_address }
environments.mail-properties.test.password: { application_password }
```

- Default admin account information can be changed from ```application.yaml```:

```yaml
environments.default-headmaster-account.credentials: { email }, { password }
environments.default-headmaster-account.details: { first-name }, { last-name }, { gender }
```

- **JSON** Web Token secret can be configured from ```application.yaml``` or creating system path variable with name _
  JWT_SECRET_:

```yaml
jwt.secret: ${JWT_SECRET:{default_secret}}
```

- Initializing test data can be done by running the **HTTP** collection file
  from ```src/test/resources/InitializeDatabaseCollectionRequest.http```. Before initializing the test data, Java DSL
  configuration for the [SecurityConfig.java](src/main/java/org/modis/EmsApplication/config/SecurityConfig.java) must be
  changed. Follow the steps bellow:

1. Comment method <u>**securityFilterChain**</u>
2. Uncomment method <u>**securityFilterChainTestDataInit**</u>
3. Run the application
4. Run <u>**InitializeDatabaseCollectionRequest.http**</u>
5. Stop the application
6. Reverse the changes by comment method <u>**securityFilterChainTestDataInit**</u> and uncomment <u>**
   securityFilterChain**</u>

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.",
